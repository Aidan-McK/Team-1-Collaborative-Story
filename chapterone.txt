Chapter One: 
It was a dark and stormy night. The rain pattered against the window, 
but a lone cursor blinked on a screen, ready to write the next chapter.

This lone cursor belonged to Charles, a renowned thriller author who 
captivated his audience with stories of mystery and murder. On this dark
and stormy night, he was working on his next novel, possibly his biggest 
one yet. A story about a charcter in a house, on a night similar to the
one Charles was in, who gets stalked and attacked by hackers trying to steal
his identity and steal his information.
Working on the current chapter, Charles starts to notice his computer getting 
slower. Strange applications were showing up and his writing application kept 
crashing. 
"What is going on"
Suddenly, an email came through his inbox, its subject line blank, its sender unknown. 
Curiosity edged into unease as Charles hovered his mouse over the message. 
The storm outside rumbled, as if echoing the tension in his chest. 
With a single click, the screen flickered, and the words appeared:
“We’re already inside.”
Charles froze. What began as fiction on his screen was quickly becoming his reality.
